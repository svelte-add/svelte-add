# @svelte-add/ast-tooling

This package provides tools and methods for parsing and serializing CSS, HTML and JS AST's. As the main [svelte-add](https://svelte-add.com) project requires all of these tools they have been extracted into this separate project.

Additionally this separate package allows us to bundle all (currently 8) required dependencies into on single package.
