              Please note that creating and maintaining adders requires a huge time
              investment. Therefore, it's impossible to create a adder for every
              random tool you will find. Nevertheless, your suggestion will be
              considered to be added based on the popularity and the general fit into
              the svelte ecosystem.


              In order to simplify the creation of new adders from a development
              perspective, please answer the following questions.
